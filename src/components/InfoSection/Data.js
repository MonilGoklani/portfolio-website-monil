    "Hi!  My name is Monil and I am an Austin based software developer.\n\nMy path to becoming a software developer has been anything but conventional. Prior to fully transitioning to a full-time developer role in early 2020, I enjoyed almost a decade long career in controls engineering and management.\n\nIn the initial four years of my career, I served as a validation engineer, creating automated test scripts to assess the controls software of engines manufactured by Cummins. Subsequently, I spent the following four years overseeing the software and calibration development process for Cummins 12-liter engine, all while pursuing an MBA in the evenings at Kelley School of Business.\n\nHowever, my journey towards web development truly began to unfold in 2019. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for the field while leading IOT projects with telematics providers to integrate Cummins digital solutions. Collaborating closely with web developers on a daily basis, I found myself increasingly immersed in their world, often taking on minor implementations myself. After six months of self-directed learning and assisting developers, I made the bold decision to enroll in a six-month software engineering immersive program at Fullstack Academy in 2020.\n\nToday, I proudly identify as a full-stack developer with four years of experience in crafting cutting-edge web and mobile applications using JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js, GraphQL, and AWS serverless technologies.",
